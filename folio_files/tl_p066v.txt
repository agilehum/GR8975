To make <fr><m>or</m> mat</fr> beautiful, put in a little varnish or <m>fatty oil</m>, not the kind that is made from cleaning brushes, but the pure kind, that is made fatty in the sun, or mixed with <m>ceruse</m>.</ab>

 

<ab><fr><m>Or</m> mat</fr> of this kind is scarcely less beautiful than burnished <fr><del>es</del></fr> <m>gold</m>, and lasts longer in the rain &amp; the like, &amp; <sup>is</sup> made more quickly. Burnished <m>gold</m> cracks with time and comes apart in the rain.</ab>
