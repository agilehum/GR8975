<heading>To make <m>vermillion</m></heading>

<block>Take two pounds of <m>sulphur</m>, and melt it, and add two pounds of <m>mercury</m> to it. And if this material ignites, cover it quite neatly, so that the air does not pass into the <m>pot</m>, then put everything for some time after into a <m>leaded pot</m>, into the fire. In the space of twenty-four hours, you will have good <m>vermillion</m>.</block>
