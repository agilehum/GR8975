The glass vessel must be either pear-shaped or round pyramid-shaped, of  the same thickness as the small back of a knife, round on the bottom without folding over on itself, like flasks, its opening of such a size that a Dutch feather can just about get in, with a lip at the end, in this way of the height of seven fingers' width.
